## Instructions

- This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
- The project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
Detect the element location relative to the viewport using built-in function:

```
.getBoundingClientRect()
```
