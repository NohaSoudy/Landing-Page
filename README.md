## Project Description

- This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
- The project use HTML and CSS and Javascript to build it.
- The project is Responsive across all devices, such as modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.
- While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections.
- We need to add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
  Detect the element location relative to the viewport using built-in function:

```
.getBoundingClientRect()
```
